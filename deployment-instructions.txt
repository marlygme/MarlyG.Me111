DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLOUDFLARE PAGES
============================================

To ensure the popup fixes work on your live site at www.marlyg.me:

1. CLEAR CLOUDFLARE CACHE:
   - Go to your Cloudflare dashboard
   - Navigate to Caching > Configuration
   - Click "Purge Everything" to clear all cached files
   - This ensures the live site gets the latest JavaScript

2. SYNC WITH REMOTE:
   - Click "Sync with remote" in Replit to push changes
   - Wait for deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

3. FORCE REFRESH YOUR BROWSER:
   - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
   - Mobile: Clear browser cache in settings

4. TEST THE FIX:
   - Open browser console (F12) and look for "[PopupFix]" messages
   - Click on Tools and navigate - should stay in same window
   - Try typing URLs manually - should work normally

5. IF STILL NOT WORKING:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Try in incognito/private mode
   - Test on different devices/browsers
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled

The fix includes:
- Aggressive popup prevention that runs before Readymag loads
- Multiple fallback mechanisms to catch all popup attempts
- Continuous monitoring that fixes links even after dynamic loading
- Cache-busting query parameters to force reload

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- All links with target="_blank" are automatically fixed
- window.open is overridden to prevent popups
- MutationObserver watches for new elements
- Periodic checks every 3-5 seconds as failsafe
